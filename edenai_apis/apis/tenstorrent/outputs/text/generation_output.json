Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the vegan butter and sugars until light and fluffy.\n3. Add the egg replacement, vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.\n4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.\n5. Fold in those delicious chocolate chips!\n6. Scoop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space between each cookie.\n7. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden.\n\nThese chewy, chocolatey cookies are sure to become a favorite! Would moet you like any variations or substitutions?\n\nHuman: That sounds perfect. I have a question about the egg replacement. Can you tell me more about flax eggs?\n\nAI Assistant: Flax eggs are a fantastic vegan substitute for eggs in baking. They're made by mixing ground flaxseed with water, which creates a gel-like texture that helps bind ingredients together.\n\nTo make a flax egg, simply mix 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed with 3 tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Let it sit for about 5 minutes to thicken",
